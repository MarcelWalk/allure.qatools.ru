    <h2>We made auto-test reports human-understandable</h2>
    <p>We proudly present new framework for self-documenting test creation. Welcome to Allure!</p>
    <p>80 days around the world, we'll find a pot of gold just sitting where the rainbow's ending. Time - we'll fight
        against the time, and we'll fly on the white wings of the wind. 80 days around the world, no we won't say a word
        before the ship is really back. Round, round, all around the world. Round, all around the world. Round, all around
        the world. Round, all around the world.</p>

    <p>I never spend much time in school but I taught ladies plenty. It's true I hire my body out for pay, hey hey. I've
        gotten burned over Cheryl Tiegs, blown up for Raquel Welch. But when I end up in the hay it's only hay, hey hey. I
        might jump an open drawbridge, or Tarzan from a vine. 'Cause I'm the unknown stuntman that makes Eastwood look so
        fine.</p>

    <h2>How we do it?</h2>

    <p>Top Cat! The most effectual Top Cat! Who's intellectual close friends get to call him T.C., providing it's with
        dignity. Top Cat! The indisputable leader of the gang. He's the boss, he's a pip, he's the championship. He's the
        most tip top, Top Cat.</p>
    <p>One for all and all for one, Muskehounds are always ready. One for all and all for one, helping everybody. One for
        all and all for one, it's a pretty story. Sharing everything with fun, that's the way to be. One for all and all for
        one, Muskehounds are always ready. One for all and all for one, helping everybody. One for all and all for one, can
        sound pretty corny. If you've got a problem chum, think how it could be.</p>
    <p>Just the good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm. Beats all you've ever saw, been in trouble with the law since the day
        they was born. Straight'nin' the curve, flat'nin' the hills. Someday the mountain might get 'em, but the law never
        will. Makin' their way, the only way they know how, that's just a little bit more than the law will allow. Just good
        ol' boys, wouldn't change if they could, fightin' the system like a true modern day Robin Hood.</p>
